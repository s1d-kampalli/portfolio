            Hi, I'm <span class="about-highlight">Sid Kampalli</span>, a Computing Security &amp; Technology major at Drexel University and someone who's passionate about <span class="about-highlight">technology, leadership, and helping others grow</span>. <br><br>
            When I’m not deep into school stuff, you’ll probably find me exploring Philly’s food scene, playing Golf, reading Game of Thrones or working out at the Gym. <br><br>
            I love building things, whether that’s dashboards for work, new connections on campus, or creative solutions to tough problems!
